# Dynamic_Pricing_Research_Topic_Team_3

Welcome to the Dynamic Pricing and Algorithmic Price Management project! This repository explores the strategic advantages of dynamic pricing for sellers and delves into algorithmic price management. Here's a brief overview:

Key Points:

1. Dynamic Pricing Advantage:

Sellers gain a strategic edge by actively responding to market changes and demand fluctuations.

2. Algorithmic Price Management:

Explore how algorithmic pricing components enhance strategies across digital channels and online marketplaces.

3. Importance of Dynamic Pricing:

Essential in dynamic environments with constant product influx, offering efficient ways to learn price-demand functions.

4. Challenges:

Address challenges like limited historical data, active market exploration needs, and constraints on price adjustment frequency.

5. Limited Price Change Frequency:

Optimize scenarios with restricted price change frequencies, such as flash sales, by generating and testing price-demand function hypotheses.

6. Multi-Armed Bandit Algorithms:

Implement continuous pricing experimentation using favored algorithms like Thompson sampling, adaptable to market dynamics.

7. Bayesian Models for Thompson Sampling:

Explore simple analytically designed Bayesian models for Thompson sampling and leverage probabilistic programming for more complex scenarios.

8. Traditional Price Management:

Learn how traditional price management optimization methods remain effective, especially in cases with cross-product effects or inventory constraints.
